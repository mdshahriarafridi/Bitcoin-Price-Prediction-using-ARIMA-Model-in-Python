ðŸ’¼ Data Source: Bitcoin price data from Yahoo Finance in USD
ðŸ”— Time Period: Sept 17, 2014 to October 10, 2024

### Model Summary:
1. The MAPE of 1.94% shows the model makes relatively 98.06% accurate predictions.
2. The MSE and RMSE values, while large, are in line with the scale of the dataset.
3. The MAE of 1,926 units suggests the model is generally close to the actual values.
4. The RÂ² value of 0.9843 indicates that the model explains 98.43%, a high proportion of the variance in the data, which is a sign of a good fit.

Overall, The ARIMA model performs well, with strong accuracy metrics and a high RÂ² value indicating a good fit for the time series data.
